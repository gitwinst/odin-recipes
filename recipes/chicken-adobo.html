    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken adobo is a classic Filipino dish that's as savory as it is bright with acid, and it goes perfectly with a large platter of garlic fried rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 avocado or coconut oil</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup coconut aminos</li>
        <li>½ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickling spice, wrapped in cheesecloth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until oil is shimmering. Cook garlic in oil for no more than 30 seconds. Add all of the chicken to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is white all over. Do not brown.</li>
        <li>Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, and water, and add the pickling spice. Make sure the spice ball is submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and place lid on pot so that some steam can escape. Simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.</li>        
    </ol>
