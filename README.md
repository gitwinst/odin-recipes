# odin-recipes

Prompt: describe the current project, and what skills you will have demonstrated upon completion.

The prompt is to create a website containing a list of links to recipes on other sites using only HTML.

Doing so will demonstrate a rudimentary understanding of HTML and the basics of web development. Specifically, completing this project will require an understanding of:
 - creating an HTML document;
 - what a boilerplate html file contains;
 - the file structure of a simple website;
 - how to use simple html elements such as p, a, and img tags, among others;
 - git and its core functionality;
 - githubhtml

 Reflection:
  - You forgot and remembered the charset attr on the meta tag :)
  - You used width on the image tag. I remember that attr from long, long ago. I assume using it is basically an html5 cardinal sin :P
  - HTML is fun! Why does CSS have to be so dreadful? :(
  - You learned some new recipes :D
